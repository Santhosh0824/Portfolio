Santhosh was employed by Infosys and served as a key member of the Application Management Services (AMS) team. In this capacity, he supported several critical applications and processes for which I was the subject matter expert.

Santhosh consistently demonstrated a high level of reliability and professionalism. He approached every task with dedication and delivered excellent results, often going above and beyond expectations to ensure smooth operations. Our various systems were mission critical and often involved late nights and high-pressue situations, which he handled well.

I would highly recommend Santhosh for any role requiring technical ability, dependability, and a commitment to excellence. He would be a tremendous asset to any organization, and I am confident he will continue to excel in his future endeavors.
